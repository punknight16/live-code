			<h2>Value Proposition</h2>
			<hr class='one-column-40' style='border-width: 2px; border-color: black;' />
			<br />
			<h3 class='one-column-60'>
				I have noticed a trend with chat applications like Slack and Discord where people post their marketing materials, and then just move on. I think the chat experience would be better served if it was used to work on products collaboratively. The goal is to build products and build partnerships in the process.

			<h2>Partnerships</h2>
			<hr class='one-column-40' style='border-width: 2px; border-color: black;' />
			<br />
			<h3 class='one-column-60'>
				I have written about five applications at this point, and I think I see a trend. At the beginning of each project, there seems to be a ton of potential. As the project comes into focus, cool use cases fall into obscurity. The ultimate product is a shell of what it could be. This time around, I'm getting people in on the project early, and they can play around with tools and help guide the direction of the project. I am very interested in incorporating other people's alpha and beta projects, so they can get some early feedback.

			<h2>Features</h2>

			<br />
			<h3 class='one-column-60'>
				I have been helping people here and there with their books, blogs, and larger coding projects. I think a few features could be really helpful for developing these content items further:
				<br />
				<br />
				<div class='d-flex'><ul >
					<li>Voice Chat</li>
					<li>Live Editing of Content</li>
					<li>Screen Sharing</li>
				</ul></div>
				<br />
				This is what I think, but I could be wrong. I'm very interested in what YOU would like in a live chat application. Here are some key questions:
				<br />
				<br />
				<div class='d-flex'><ol>
					<li>What is your specific use case?</li>
					<li>What feature(s) would you want to be present?</li>
					<li>What feature(s) would you want to be absent?</li>
				</ol></div>
