demo

I need to be able talk to the person
I need to be able to control their screen with my console and make them go whoa

Maybe give them two options

1) play dnd -> door opening animation (with sound), top down room click statue and get text (1x1x1 block puzzle),
2) create a page -> template --add, section --add, font --cycle, bg-color --cycle, text-color --cycle, timestamp --add (where-ever the focus is)


1. solo page with chat bar
2. create content editable element (display to others in room)
3. edit content editable element

A. Get it to run on computer (dev branch)
B. Get it to run on heroku (heroku branch)
C. Get it to run on Elastic Beanstalk (prod branch)
