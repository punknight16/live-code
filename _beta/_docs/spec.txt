demo

I need to be able talk to the person
I need to be able to control their screen with my console and make them go whoa

Maybe give them two options

1) play dnd -> door opening animation (with sound), top down room click statue and get text (1x1x1 block puzzle),
2) create a page -> template --add, section --add, font --cycle, bg-color --cycle, text-color --cycle, timestamp --add (where-ever the focus is)
