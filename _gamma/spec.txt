1. add an "a" to where the cursor is, and place the cursor after it.

-->get where the cursor is
-->place an 'a' after it
-->place the cursor after the a


where the cursor is:

each section has root id, so we find the section_id, and create a json tag model

dom_map = [
	{ 
		tagname: 'SECTION', html: {
			tagname: 'P', text: 'Hello world!'
		}
	}
]
dom_caret = [0, 15]

first position tells you what node in a depth or breadth first search
seccond position tells you what offset
